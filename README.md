Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb booking data for New York City to uncover key insights into the short-term lodging market. The primary goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create visualizations that can help various users, including guests, hosts, and researchers, make informed decisions.

Problem Statement
The rapid growth of the hospitality industry, driven by online platforms like Airbnb, has created new opportunities and challenges. This project aims to address some of these challenges by providing data-driven insights into the Airbnb market. Key questions the analysis answers include:

What are the most common types of properties available?

Which neighborhoods have the highest concentration of listings?

How do prices vary across different neighborhood groups?

Is there a relationship between a property's construction year and its price?

Are hosts with verified identities more likely to receive positive reviews?

What is the correlation between a listing's price and its service fee?

The insights from this project are valuable for a wide range of end users:

Travelers/Guests: To help them find affordable accommodations in different neighborhoods.

Hosts: To enable them to set competitive and fair prices for their listings.

Tourism Industry Professionals: For analyzing accommodation trends and understanding market dynamics.

Researchers/Students: As a case study for learning data analysis and visualization techniques.
